Iâ€™m a software engineering student at UBA (Buenos Aires University) who loves solving complex problems, new challenges and learning things.

I have been working at [Southworks](http://blogs.southworks.net/) since 2008 and
have had the chance to work with the following teams at Microsoft:

* Patterns & Practices, dealing mostly with Prism and the Smart Client & Web Client Software Factories.
* Developer platform evangelism, collaborating in the creation of demos and training kits including the [//build/](http://www.buildwindows.com/) 2012 & 2013 demos.
* Media & Advertising, working on the [Rought Cut Editor 2.0](http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/VideoEditor) and contributing to [various projects](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/08/21/windows-azure-media-services-and-the-london-2012-olympics.aspx) for the London 2012 Olympics.
