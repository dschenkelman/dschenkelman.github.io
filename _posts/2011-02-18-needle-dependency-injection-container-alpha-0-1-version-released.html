<p>A couple of days ago I uploaded to <a href="http://nuget.org/Packages/Packages/Details/NeedleContainer-0-1">NuGet</a> (which was really easy BTW) the <a href="http://needlecontainer.codeplex.com/releases/view/60894">first alpha release</a> of the <a href="http://needlecontainer.codeplex.com/">Needle Container</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/files/2011/02/image.png"><img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/files/2011/02/image_thumb.png" border="0" alt="image" width="475" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>Needle is a lightweight dependency injection container. Initially the project came up as something to do on weekends and boring afternoons with practicing goals (TDD, reflection), but after that I started putting more work into it, by adding documentation in code, and basic features that are commonly found in other containers such as Autofac or Unity.</p>
<p>You can download the <strong>Nuget</strong> package using the following command, which will automatically include a reference to the container’s assembly.</p>
<p><textarea>PM&gt; Install-Package NeedleContainer</textarea></p>
<p>Some of the features that are part of this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructor Injection</li>
<li>Property Injection</li>
<li>Type mapping using lifetime scopes and Ids</li>
<li>Storing instances using various Ids</li>
<li>Asynchronous object resolution</li>
<li>Fluent API</li>
<li>Support to inject factories using Func&lt;T&gt;</li>
<li>Support to inject instances for all stored registrations using IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>After I come back from my holidays, I expect to be adding more functionality to it in my free time (collaborators are welcome, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/dschenkelman">contact me through codeplex</a>), as well as doing a couple of posts on the most relevant features, for instance how the Fluent API works and how to perform asynchronous resolution.</p>
<p>If you try it out, let me know what you think of it. You can use the <a href="http://needlecontainer.codeplex.com/discussions">discussions boards</a> to do so.</p>
