<p>This is going to be a short one, but could potentially save someoneâ€™s time in the future.</p>
<p>I spent most of the day trying to find out why some simple C# code that was supposed to send multicast packages through the network (similar to the one provided in <a href="http://www.jarloo.com/c-udp-multicasting-tutorial/">this blog post</a>) was not working when running in my laptop.</p>
<p>Using Wireshark I was not able to capture any of the packages that should have been travelling across my LAN and after trying a whole lot of things what did the trick was disabling the <em>vEthernet (Internal Ethernet Port Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch)</em><strong> </strong>adapter that is installed with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-downloads">Visual Studio 2013 Preview</a> as part of the Windows Phone 8 Developer Tools.</p>
