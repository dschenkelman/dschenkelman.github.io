With my friend [Matias Servetto](https://github.com/smatias1989) we are currently working on our final college assignment, which is:

> A JavaScript library that leverages Web Workers to provide parallelism when working with Typed Arrays.

We are [developing the library in Github](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs) as an open source project and have recently released [version 0.1.0](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/releases/tag/v0.1.0) which provides support to perform the `map` operation in parallel.

One of the main goals of the library is to abstract parallelism as much as possible from a developer's standpoint, as it can be seen from its API:

{% highlight javascript %}
var pjs = require('p-j-s');

pjs.init(); // initialize the library

pjs(new Uint32Array([1,2,3,4])).map(function(e){
    return e * 2;
}, function(result){
    // use result...

    // if we are not using the library any more cleanup once we are done
    pjs.terminate();
});
{% endhighlight %}

You can find the current documentation in the project's [readme](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/blob/dev/README.md) as well as some cool examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/tree/dev/examples).

>We have tested the library on Chrome and Firefox. We know it does not work in Safari and have not tried IE yet.

Also, if you are interested in TypedArrays, Web Workers and JS performance you will find lots of interesting content in the [report *.tex files](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/tree/dev/docs/report).

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/issues/new) if you have any feedback!
