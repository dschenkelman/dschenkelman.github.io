<p>A <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/pull/485#issuecomment-27433217">couple of weeks ago</a> we introduced a new <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs">scriptcs</a> feature (available through the nightly builds) that allows you to execute your scripts, compile them to a .dll, and store it in a hidden folder for caching purposes. This greatly reduces start-up time (although there is still room for improvement) as we execute the .dll if it is available, thus avoiding some steps that we would need to perform otherwise.</p>
<p>We have created an <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Compiling-%28and-caching%29-to-a-.dll" target="_blank">article in the wiki</a> that explains how the feature works and goes over some ideas for future improvements.</p>
<p>If you get the chance, please try the feature out as we would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get your feedback as to how you are using it to keep improving the experience</li>
<li>Know if there are any bugs/issues that you encounter</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any ideas go ahead and create a <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/new" target="_blank">new issue</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun scripting!!</p>
