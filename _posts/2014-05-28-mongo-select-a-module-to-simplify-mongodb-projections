Today I started to work on adding field selection capabilities to some of the endpoints used by the [Auth0 app](http://app.auth0.com). Part of that involves updating the mongodb queries to [limit the fields returned by them](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/).

As this work will probably span a set of queries, I decided to create a module to simplify the creation of the projection objects used for the queries. That's how **mongo-select** came to be:
* [Github site](https://github.com/dschenkelman/mongo-select)
* [NPM site](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mongo-select)

As the mongodb [documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/) clearly explains, you can either
* Determine a set of fields to include by specifying their name and a related _truthy_ value `{ name: true }`.
* Determine a set of fields to exclude by specifying their name and a related _falsy_ value `{ name: false }`.
