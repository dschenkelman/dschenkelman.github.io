<p>Today, the new version of the Microsoft Media Platform (MMP) Video Editor <a href="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/VideoEditor/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5763">was released</a> to the public. The new release is based on Silverlight 5, and has a lot (really a lot!) of new features (fully listed below), such as a UI based on floating windows, and a new Sub-Clip tool which gives editors more control when creating clips.</p>
<p>You can play with the new version at <a href="http://videoeditor.cloudapp.net/">http://videoeditor.cloudapp.net/</a>.</p>
<p>The downloadable packages of the new release are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MMP Video Editor 2.0 Source Code:</strong> Useful in case you want to know how the different features are implemented.</li>
<li><strong>MMP Video Editor 2.0 Binaries:</strong> If you don’t care about the source and just can’t wait to host it.</li>
<li><strong>MMP Video Editor 2.0 Documentation:</strong> Updated documentation, including the <strong>“New Features in the MMP Video Editor 2.0” </strong>that provides a brief overview of the brand new features.</li>
<li><strong>MMP Video Editor 2.0 Overlays &amp; Rubberbanding Plugin Sample:</strong> Two plug-ins for the "Microsoft Media Platform Player Framework (formerly SMF)" were created to manage overlays and rubber-banding in CSMs (see new features document). The sample includes the source code for the plug-ins and a sample player that showcases the plug-ins’ capabilities.</li>
</ul>
