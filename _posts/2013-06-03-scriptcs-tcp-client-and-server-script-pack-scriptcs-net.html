<p>Last week, I gave a brown bag talk at Southworks about scriptcs and one of the things I explained in depth were <a href="http://blog.martindoms.com/2013/05/14/building-scriptcs-script-pack/">script packs</a>. If this is the first time you hear about scriptcs be sure to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs">Github Project</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://scriptcs.net/">Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProjectlessScriptedCWithScriptCSAndRoslyn.aspx">Hanselman’s blog post</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki">wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of information out there, and things are moving really fast so there is no sense in writing everything down here as some of it would be deprecated in a couple of months.</p>
<h2>Script Pack Concept</h2>
<p><strong><em>Currently</em></strong>, a script pack is a .dll that exposes an object which simplifies interaction with a set of components. To get a better idea of how this works, check out the existing <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Script-Packs-master-list">script packs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Authoring-script-packs">tutorials on how to create one</a>. The reason I say "currently"<strong> </strong>is that at some point in the near future you will be able to <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/238">create your script packs using .csx script files</a>.</p>
<p>As this is one of the best features of scriptcs (in my opinion), since it allows you to get up and running with your favorites libraries in no time, I decided I had to create a simple script pack that will show how to take advantage of it. It seems I did a good job selling it, as my friend Ezequiel Jadib went ahead and created a <a href="https://github.com/ejadib/scriptcs-azuremediaservices/">script pack of his own</a> that allows you to <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/ejadib/2013/05/31/enjoy-windows-azure-media-services-in-the-comfort-of-your-own-console/">interact with Azure Media Services from the scriptcs REPL</a>.</p>
<h2>ScriptCs.Net Script Pack</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/net.html">node.js net module</a> I created a script pack that allows you to easily create TCP server and clients, abstracting you from all the complexity of using sockets. For example, to setup a TCP server you can simply write something like:</p>
<code data-gist-id="3bd93b01b83b3eac8655" data-gist-file="sample.csx"></code>
<p>I’m only going to include that simple piece of code in this blog post, as the <a href="https://github.com/dschenkelman/scriptcs-net">project’s home page</a> is updated whenever the API changes and I also created a sample that shows you how to setup a <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs-samples/tree/master/net">simple chat</a>.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>At the moment I intend to continue adding features as I see fit, but your feedback will definitely be welcome either in the form of PRs or <a href="https://github.com/dschenkelman/scriptcs-net/issues">issues</a>.  Most of the features that will be added are going to be used to implement a multi-user interactive REPL that leverages this script pack for communication and <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/ScriptCs.Core">ScriptCs.Core</a> to interpret the scripts.</p>
