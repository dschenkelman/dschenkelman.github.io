<p>Over the last week, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/matiasb/">Matias</a> and I took some time to work on something a Prism Training Kit. We figured out that was one of the things that would be useful to learn Prism. Therefore, we decided to create a set of Hands on Labs that cover the basic topics addressed by Prism (if you can't wait to download the TK, go <a href="http://prismtk.codeplex.com/releases/view/48211">here</a>).</p>
<p>As always your feedback is really appreciated, and we hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>This Training Kit contains 5 Hands-On-Labs that cover the most important concepts of Prism v2. Each Lab includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A startup Visual Studio application for each exercise in the lab for you to start working on the lab.</li>
<li>A a step-by-step documentÂ  with code snippets and screen-shots that guide you on how to include key prism features.</li>
<li>An end application for each exercise in the lab, with the resulting solution after performing all the lab's steps.</li>
</ul>
