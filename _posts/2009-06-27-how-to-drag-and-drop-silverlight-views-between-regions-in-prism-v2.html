<p>As some of you may know, some weeks ago I <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/06/05/how-to-drag-and-drop-wpf-views-between-regions-in-prism-v2/">blogged about how to drag and drop WPF views between regions in Prism-v2</a>. Well, today I started spiking and was able to create the same sample for Silverlight (thanks <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez/">Julian</a> and <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/ejadib/">Ezequiel</a> for your contributions). So, if you were interested in the previous spike but could not use it because you are developing a Silverlight application, you might find this sample useful.</p>
<p>I will not go over the specs, because there are no modifications required to use it compared to its WPF version (explained in my <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/06/05/how-to-drag-and-drop-wpf-views-between-regions-in-prism-v2/">related previous post</a>). However, I did modify the <strong>ViewDragManager</strong> to cope with some of the WPF/Silverlight differences.</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>Below you can find a picture of how the Silverlight <strong>ViewDragManager</strong> doing its job:<br />

<p>Hope this is useful application <img src="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=")" />.</p>
