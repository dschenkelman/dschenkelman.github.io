<p>If you work with Silverlight and MVVM, you must have probably been forced to do some weird thing to bind to a property in your view model (say a Command) from a DataTemplate. Some of the common approaches I have seen and used myself are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using some kind of binding helper as a View’s resource.</li>
<li>Having a View Model wrap the entity of each collection item, and add the command to the View Model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these are perfectly valid approaches, they require extra work compared to the good old {Binding} syntax we are all used to.</p>
<p>Now that Silverlight 5 Beta is out, we can take advantage of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.markup.markupextension(VS.96).aspx">XAML Markup Extensions</a> to help is in this kind of tasks, using a simpler and more intuitive approach.</p>
<p>I have created a <strong>RootBindingExtension</strong>, which can be used as follows:</p>
<code data-gist-id="714725b67ed06edb2436" data-gist-file="Usage.xaml"></code>
<p>The <strong>RootBindingExtension </strong>uses the <strong>Path</strong> property to create a Binding that binds to a property of that name in the View’s <strong>DataContext</strong>.</p>
<code data-gist-id="714725b67ed06edb2436" data-gist-file="RootBindingExtension.cs"></code>
<p>You can download the RootBindingExtension and a sample that uses it from <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/#!/?cid=09f63fc7ac065e5e&amp;sc=documents&amp;nl=1&amp;uc=2&amp;id=9F63FC7AC065E5E%21215">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have used it.</p>
