<p>As you might have read in the blogs of some of the guys from the p&amp;p team or <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=51989">at Codeplex</a>, the <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/survey-intro.zgi?p=WEB228YSYYRK4A">Prism survey</a> is a place where you can share your thoughts, experiences, feedback (both good and bad) about using the guidance (both WPF and WPF &amp; Silverlight versions).</p>
<p>Your feedback is important to improve the guidance for the next release so please, take some time (should take about 10 minutes) to fill the <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/survey-intro.zgi?p=WEB228YSYYRK4A">survey</a>.</p>
<p>If you currently believe that something is a must for the next version of Prism, you can contact <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/blaine/">Blaine Wastell</a>, p&amp;p Program Manager, by e-mail or through a comment in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/blaine/archive/2009/04/01/have-you-taken-the-prism-survey.aspx">this post</a>.</p>
