<p>Most developers are familiar with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7d3wz0k.aspx">code snippets</a>. They are really useful while developing code, mainly because they make some of the most common developing tasks easier and faster, by making us just fill in a couple of blanks.</p>
<p>This is great, but <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez/">Julian</a> had an idea that I believe will make the code snippets we created even more useful. He said: <em>"What if we not only provide the code snippets, but we also add some guidance, links and tips based on our experience as </em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7d3wz0k.aspx"><em>Prism</em></a><em> developers, that will help others with these common tasks".</em> <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/matiasb/">Matias</a>, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/ejadib/">Ezequiel</a> and me thought this was a great idea, specially for people starting with Prism. The guidance offered in the snippets will provide insight about how <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7d3wz0k.aspx">Prism</a> works, leading to better and faster development. This guidance can simply be deleted once the code is put into place as it is just composed of code comments.</p>
<p>Without further introduction, the code snippets we created are useful for the most common ways of performing the following tasks (between brackets how to insert the snippet in code):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd490826.aspx">View Discovery</a> (prismviewdisc)</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458899.aspx">View Injection</a> (prismviewinj)</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458942.aspx">Event Publishing</a> (prismeventpub)</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458904.aspx">Event Subscribing</a> (prismeventsub)</li>
<li>Command with attached behavior (prismcmdbehavior, this was updated from <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/08/13/c-code-snippet-to-create-commands-with-attached-behaviors-using-prism/">this snippet</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below you can find a picture of the generated code for the <strong>Event Subscription</strong> snippet, so you can get an idea of about these snippets with tips:</p>

<h4>Pre-Requirements</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://cid-09f63fc7ac065e5e.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/p|0p%20Samples/PrismSnippets.vsi">Download the Snippet Visual Studio installer</a> and run the installer (the snippets are provided "AS IS"¬ù with no warranties and confers no rights). You can also get the .zip file from <a href="http://cid-09f63fc7ac065e5e.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/p|0p%20Samples/PrismSnippets.zip">here</a> if you want to edit the snippets.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the snippets help you learn Prism while developing. As always your feedback is really appreciated.</p>
