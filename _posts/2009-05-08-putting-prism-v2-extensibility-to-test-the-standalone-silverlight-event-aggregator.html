<p>This is a post I have had pending for a long time. As usual it came up after I saw <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=50536">this question</a> in the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF/Thread/List.aspx">Composite WPF &amp; Silverlight forums</a> at Codeplex.</p>
<p>The user wanted a lightweight download, and was only using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458915.aspx">Event Aggregator</a> from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fa07e1ce-ca3f-4b9b-a21b-e3fa10d013dd&amp;DisplayLang=en">CAL's latest bits</a>. I thought that this would really test Prism's extensibility, so I created a single assembly which only contained things required by the Silverlight <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458915.aspx">Event Aggregator</a>.</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>UPDATE: </strong>This assembly also works when using Silverlight 3 Beta version.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The following picture will easen the process of explaining/understanding all the classes this assembly requires. It was taken using the .Net Reflector. (Clicking it will probably make it easier to read)</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/files/2009/05/evag.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-77" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/files/2009/05/evag.png" alt="" width="400" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards I tested the correct functionality of this assembly using the EventAggregator Quickstart by replacing the events used in it with events from this new assembly.Everything worked like a charm, so Prism-v2 passed this "extensibility test" :)</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/">Glenn Block</a> has a post that explains how to perform <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2009/02/23/event-aggregation-with-mef-with-and-without-eventaggregator.aspx">Event Aggregation with MEF (with and without EventAggregator)</a>, so perhaps you could find that post interesting if you have read this far.</p>
