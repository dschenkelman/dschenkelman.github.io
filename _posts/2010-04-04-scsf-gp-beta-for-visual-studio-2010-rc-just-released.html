<p>As you might have read in the <a href="http://smartclient.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=207355">SCSF forum at Codeplex</a>, the p&amp;p team has recently shipped a beta version of the SCSF source code that runs in Visual Studio 2010. If you haven't checked it out, you can download it from <a href="http://smartclient.codeplex.com/releases/view/42559">here</a>. On this same subject, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero/">Fernando</a> has written a detailed <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero/2010/03/26/smart-client-software-factory-beta-source-for-visual-studio-2010-rc/">blog post</a> which goes over the main features in this release and some future plans.</p>
<p>If you have used the Smart Client Software Factory before, you know the source code is not all it has to offer. The p&amp;p team has released <a href="http://smartclient.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=207829">a Beta version of the SCSF Guidance Package for Visual Studio 2010 RC</a>. The great thing about it is that it can be installed through a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/quanto/archive/2009/05/26/what-is-a-vsix.aspx">.vsix f</a>ile, which will save you most of the troubles .msi installers had in previous versions (concerning dependency checking, updating the registry, etc). The .vsix file was uploaded to the Visual Studio Gallery, so it can be downloaded either from <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7c580dca-22b0-4761-bf67-72a198b6acd4">here</a> or your Visual Studio's Extension Manager (Tools-&gt;Extension Manager-&gt;Online).</p>

<p>This beta version was released with the purpose of gathering feedbackabout the Guidance Package (among other things), know about bugs and issues you run into. So, if you find a strange behavior of any kind, please let us know. The best place to drop your feedback would probably be <a href="http://smartclient.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=207829">Don's thread</a> at Codeplex, but if you feel a bit lazy about it you can always drop a comment in this post.</p>
<p>Have a nice time using the GP!</p>
