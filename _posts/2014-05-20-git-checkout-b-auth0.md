After more than 6 years working at [Southworks](blogs.southworks.net), I have decided to take on a new challenge (which might be evident due to the blog change). I got the amazing opportunity to start working there right out of high school (in the words of ABBA _"young and sweet, only seventeen"_) and was able to work with and learn from a great group of people who, by the way, also get some pretty cool stuff done.

I started my new adventure yesterday by joining [Auth0](https://auth0.com). There is also an [incredible team](https://auth0.com/about) of people there, which includes [@woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski), [@fedejack](https://twitter.com/fedejack) and [@sebasiaco](https://twitter.com/sebasiaco), all of whom I met during our time at Southworks.

This is going to be a great opportunity for me to get an idea of what it's like to work with a radically different set of technologies. I'm (mostly) used to C#, Azure and working on Windows and now I'll get to use a Mac to develop using node.js (and if I'm to believe [@woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski) _"once you try Mac you won't go back"_).

I'm also going to get the chance to do one of the things I love the most as a software developer, which is creating components for other software developers. The thought of working on [the platform](https://auth0.com/availability-trust) one day and jumping to one of [the many SDKs](https://auth0.com/how-it-works#apps-connections) any other day, always with the goal in mind of improving the experience of other fellow developers is really exciting.

As for this blog's contents, as you can guess they will probably start to get a bit more varied. I still love C# as a language and expect to continue contributing to open source projects such as [scriptcs](http://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) (although I'm on a cold streak right now) and I also plan to slowly continue [learning F#](https://github.com/dschenkelman/fakewin8/tree/fsharp) so there will still be content similar to the old one. At the same time, I really hope there will be content related to JS, identity, working at a startup and many other things, since that means I'll be learning and that makes me happy :)
